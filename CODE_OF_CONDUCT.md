# Code of Conduct – Adaptive Intelligence Circle

## Our Commitment

We are committed to maintaining a professional, respectful, and thoughtful environment for collaboration.

This project exists to explore **serious questions about
control, safety, and responsibility in adaptive systems**.
We expect contributors to engage accordingly.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on ideas, not individuals
- Accept critical feedback professionally
- Acknowledge uncertainty and limits
- Act in good faith

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Dismissive or hostile communication
- Promotion of unsafe or irresponsible AI use
- Deliberate attempts to bypass safety mechanisms
- Treating the system as a game or exploit challenge

---

## Technical Responsibility

Contributors must recognize that:
- This system deals with **powerful adaptive behavior**
- Irresponsible suggestions can cause real harm
- Safety concerns take priority over novelty

We reserve the right to reject contributions that,
while technically interesting, undermine system safety.
