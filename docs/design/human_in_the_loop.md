# Why Rollback Over Redeploy

Most systems treat redeploy as recovery.
AIC treats rollback as responsibility.

---

## 1. Redeploy Hides Causality

Redeploy:
- Resets context
- Erases history
- Masks responsibility

It solves symptoms, not causes.

---

## 2. Rollback Preserves Meaning

Rollback:
- Retains state
- Preserves timeline
- Enables explanation

This is essential for adaptive systems.

---

## 3. Trust and Accountability

Redeploy allows:
> erase → retry → forget

Rollback enforces:
> remember → reason → recover

Trust cannot be built on forgetfulness.

---

## 4. Operational Trade-off

Rollback is:
- Slower
- More complex
- Less scalable initially

But it scales **ethically and operationally** over time.

---

## 5. Conclusion

Redeploy optimizes uptime.
Rollback optimizes integrity.

AIC chooses integrity.
